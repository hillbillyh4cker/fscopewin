## 🎨 Visual Design

The interface features:

- **Matrix-style green theme** for that authentic hacker aesthetic
- **ASCII art header** with the tool name
- **Color-coded metrics** (green = good, yellow = warning, red = critical)
- **Unicode symbols and emojis** for visual clarity
- **Clean panel layout** that scales to your terminal size

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### GPU Monitoring Not Working

- Ensure NVIDIA drivers are installed
- Install `nvidia-ml-py3`: `pip3 install pynvml`
- The tool will gracefully fall back if GPU monitoring fails

### Permission Errors

- Some system metrics may require elevated permissions
- Try running with `sudo` if you encounter permission issues

### Terminal Display Issues

- Ensure your terminal supports Unicode characters
- Use a modern terminal emulator for best results
- Resize your terminal if the layout appears cramped
